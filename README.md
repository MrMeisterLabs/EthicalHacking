# EthicalHacking
Foray into H@ck1n9!

This repository captures my journey into Ethical Hacking. This will involve notes from various sources, in addition to code and scripts for the purpose of all sorts of defensive and offensive security tasks. The repository should also include references to various capture the flag (CTF) missions from various sources.
